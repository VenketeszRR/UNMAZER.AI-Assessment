          <h4>What are the functions of different types of lenses?</h4>
          <p>A telephoto is popular among photographers who want their subjects to appear closer and need that extra zoom. Usually, a telephoto is in the range of 70-200mm. Using a telephoto lens is great if you are shooting animals, portraits, wildlife, and weddings. If you like to shoot from afar, a telephoto is an essential lens to have.
             Wide lenses are typically between 14mm and 35mm. These lenses are mainly used by landscape and interior photographers. If you want to make a space or landscape appear expansive and vast, using a wide lens is your go-to option.
            Macro lenses are necessary for those who want a detailed, sharp, and close-up shot of small subjects. If you like to shoot jewelry, insects, flowers, or plants, you’ll definitely be reaching for the macro lens. These lenses allow you to get really close-up with your subject, and maintain sharp focus. There is strong emphasis on detail, texture, and vividness when shooting with a macro. Typically, the range is between 100mm to 200mm.

          <h2>Focal length</h2>

          <h4>Have you ever been awestruck by how close up and vivid some of the shots are in Planet Earth?</h4>
          <p>The focal length determines how much the lens sees, and therefore, determines how much of the scenery will be captured. We won’t go into the mathematical part focal length, but it is important to know that we use focal length to tell us what the field of view of that lens will be. The field of view tells us how much a lens can magnify distant subjects. That close-up shot of the cheetah you see on Planet Earth is probably a focal length of 600-1000mm!
             There are so many Camera Lenses for every focal length out there for you to choose from. It is important to decide what type of photography you will be pursuing and choosing the appropriate focal length for your artistic needs. If you are mainly shooting landscapes, you may want to stick with wide lenses.</p>

          <h2>What is the depth of the field and why is it important?</h2>

          <h4>What is the depth of the field and why is it important?</h4>
          <p>The Depth of Field is one of the most powerful tools you can use in photography. Why? You can control how much of the subject you want in focus. If you are shooting a beautiful forest, you may want to use deep focus, or deep depth of field so the foreground and background will be in focus.
             On the other hand, a shallow depth of field will focus on a smaller area of the image. If you want to capture your puppy’s adorable expression, for example, you may want to use a shallow depth of field to really focus on your dog’s expression and eyes. Your audience will be mesmerized by those puppy eyes because you chose them as the focal point.

          <h4>How does the exposure triangle work?</h4>
          <p>Shutter speed, aperture, and ISO are part of the Exposure Triangle. Think of each component as a variable. The exposure triangle is a common way of associating these three variables that determine the exposure of a photograph.
            The goal is to balance all three variables, so you can get the best exposure in a photo. Don’t worry, with enough practice, adjusting these three variables will be second nature to you.</p>

          <h4>What is multispectral photography used for?</h4>
          <p>Multispectral photography is used to capture a narrow range of wavelengths across the electromagnetic spectrum. Because we cannot see these wavelengths, this type of photography can be very helpful for scientists and engineers. Multispectral photography can be used in space-based imaging, military target tracking, landmine detection, ballistic missile detection, document and painting analysis, farming, healthcare, forensics, and so much more.

          <h2>How can i achieve sharp focus on my subject's eyes?</h2>

        <div class="toggle-pannel">
          <h4>How can i achieve sharp focus on my subject's eyes?</h4>
          <p>Using Single Point Focus can enhance the sharpness of your subject’s eyes, but make sure you place the focus point right on their eyes, or closest to their eyes. If you are shooting portraits and your subject is still, using manual focus is the most reliable method.
             If you haven’t already, check out our page where we talk about back button focus. This method is very effective if your subject is moving and you want to maintain sharp focus on the subject’s eyes. As always, try to use a tripod if possible and keep the ISO low.</p>

          <h4>RAW vs JPEG?</h4>
          <p>RAW is a large, uncompressed flat file that contains all of the image data captured by the sensor before any post-processing is applied. RAW files are also a significantly larger size than JPEG because they contain all the image information from the sensor.
             JPEG files are processed right within the camera. While color temperature and exposure are set based on your camera settings when the image is shot, the camera will also process the image then render the file to a compressed JPEG. Both have their advantages and disadvantages depending on your needs.</p>

          <h4>What is a basic rules for macro photography?</h4>
          <p>Macro photography is all about details and being close up with your subject. This means it will be necessary for you to minimize shakiness and use a sturdy tripod. Typically with macro shots, you want to shoot head-on with the subject, instead of trying to shoot from an angle.
             It is also helpful to turn off autofocus when shooting macro photography and use manual focus instead. You may want to use aperture f/22 or as close to that number as possible for maximum sharpness.</p>
